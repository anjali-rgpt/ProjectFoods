# ProjectFoods
A project built in Java by 4 humans for an OOPS course. Early version. Lots of bugs. Simulation of food-related business.

The project aims to provide a simulation of a working food-industry  component, like a restaurant or a takeout place. We hope to be able to drive it into the real-world at some point in time. 
There are two modes: One is the admin mode, which allows the user to take on the role of the Administrator, who basically has control over the menu, price and quantity. This mode is secured with a rudimentary and predefined username-password combo as of now.

The second is the Customer mode, which allows the Customer to place orders after viewing the menu, view the bill, register for delivery and then wait for the food.

Issues with code: Currently there is a problem with adding food items that have two or more words, hence Camel Case is preferable.
                  Preparation time of food is factored in while adding completed food to tray, but the Order Ready message comes almost instantly after confirmation, which is not acceptable. 
                  
                  
                  WORK IN PROGRESS.
